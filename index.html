                    Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept
                    of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way
                    to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with
                    subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.
                    The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary. Creating new words in prose is usually bad style. But in programming, it is
                    indispensable.
                    Typical adult English speakers have some 20,000 words in their vocabulary.
                    Few programming languages come with 20,000 commands built in. And the
                    vocabulary that is available tends to be more precisely defined, and thus less
                    flexible, than in human language. Therefore, we usually have to introduce new
                    concepts to avoid repeating ourselves too much.

                  <p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is
                    a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that
                    produces the square of a given number:
                  </p>

                  <code>
                    const square = function(x) {
                      return x * x;
                      };
                      console.log(square(12));
                      // → 144
                  </code>

                  <p>
                    A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function
                    . Functions have a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body, which
                    contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called.
                    The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in
                    braces, even when it consists of only a single statement. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all. In the
                    following example, makeNoise does not list any parameter names, whereas power
                    lists two:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                    const makeNoise = function() {
                      console.log("Pling!");
                      };
                      makeNoise();
                      // → Pling!
                      const power = function(base, exponent) {
                      let result = 1;
                      for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
                      result *= base;
                      }
                      return result;
                      };
                      console.log(power(2, 10));
                      // → 1024
                  </code>

              <article>
                  <p>
                    Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding
                    is visible. For bindings defined outside of any function or block, the scope is
                    the whole program—you can refer to such bindings wherever you want. These
                    are called global.
                    But bindings created for function parameters or declared inside a function
                    can be referenced only in that function, so they are known as local bindings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Every time the function is called, new instances of these bindings are created.
                    This provides some isolation between functions—each function call acts in its
                    own little world (its local environment) and can often be understood without
                    knowing a lot about what’s going on in the global environment.
                    Bindings declared with let and const are in fact local to the block that they
                    are declared in, so if you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and
                    after the loop cannot “see” it. In pre-2015 JavaScript, only functions created
                    new scopes, so old-style bindings, created with the var keyword, are visible
                    throughout the whole function that they appear in—or throughout the global
                    scope, if they are not in a function.
                  </p>
                    <code>
                      let x = 10;
                      if (true) {
                      let y = 20;
                      var z = 30;
                      console.log(x + y + z);
                      // → 60
                      }
                      // y is not visible here
                      console.log(x + z);
                      // → 40
                    </code>

                    <p>
                      Each scope can “look out” into the scope around it, so x is visible inside the
                      block in the example. The exception is when multiple bindings have the same
                      name—in that case, code can see only the innermost one. For example, when
                      the code inside the halve function refers to n, it is seeing its own n, not the
                      global n.
                    </p>

                    <code>
                      const halve = function(n) {
                        return n / 2;
                        };
                        let n = 10;
                        console.log(halve(100));
                        // → 50
                        console.log(n);
                        // → 10 
                    </code>

                    JavaScript distinguishes not just global and local bindings. Blocks and functions
                    can be created inside other blocks and functions, producing multiple degrees
                    of locality.
                    For example, this function—which outputs the ingredients needed to make
                    a batch of hummus—has another function inside it:
                  </p>
                 
                  <code>
                    const hummus = function(factor) {
                      const ingredient = function(amount, unit, name) {
                      let ingredientAmount = amount * factor;
                      if (ingredientAmount > 1) {
                      unit += "s";
                      }
                      console.log(`${ingredientAmount} ${unit} ${name}`);
                      };
                      ingredient(1, "can", "chickpeas");
                      ingredient(0.25, "cup", "tahini");
                      ingredient(0.25, "cup", "lemon juice");
                      ingredient(1, "clove", "garlic");
                      ingredient(2, "tablespoon", "olive oil");
                      ingredient(0.5, "teaspoon", "cumin");
                      };
                  </code>
                  <p>
                    The code inside the ingredient function can see the factor binding from
                    the outer function. But its local bindings, such as unit or ingredientAmount,
                    are not visible in the outer function.
                    The set of bindings visible inside a block is determined by the place of that
                    block in the program text. Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that
                    contain it, and all scopes can see the global scope. This approach to binding
                    visibility is called lexical scoping.

              <article>
                  
                  <p>
                    A function binding usually simply acts as a name for a specific piece of the
                    program. Such a binding is defined once and never changed. This makes it
                    easy to confuse the function and its name.
                    But the two are different. A function value can do all the things that other
                    values can do—you can use it in arbitrary expressions, not just call it. It is
                    possible to store a function value in a new binding, pass it as an argument to
                    a function, and so on. Similarly, a binding that holds a function is still just a
                    regular binding and can, if not constant, be assigned a new value, like so:
                  </p>

                  <code>
                    let launchMissiles = function() {
                      missileSystem.launch("now");
                      };
                      if (safeMode) {
                      launchMissiles = function() {/* do nothing */};
                      }
                  </code>

              <article>
                  <p>
                    There is a slightly shorter way to create a function binding. When the function
                    keyword is used at the start of a statement, it works differently.
                  </p>
                 
                      <code>
                        function square(x) {
                          return x * x;
                          }
                        </code>

                      <p>
                        This is a function declaration. The statement defines the binding square and
                        points it at the given function. It is slightly easier to write and doesn’t require
                        a semicolon after the function.
                        There is one subtlety with this form of function definition.
                      </p>

                      <code>
                        console.log("The future says:", future());
                        function future() {
                        return "You'll never have flying cars";
                        }
                      </code>

                      <p>
                        The preceding code works, even though the function is defined below the code
                        that uses it. Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom
                        flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can
                        be used by all the code in that scope. This is sometimes useful because it offers
                        the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying
                        about having to define all functions before they are used.
                      </P>

             <article>
                 
                      <p>
                        There’s a third notation for functions, which looks very different from the
                        others. Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (=>) made up of an
                        equal sign and a greater-than character (not to be confused with the greaterthan-or-equal operator, which is written >=).
                      </p>
                      <code>
                        const power = (base, exponent) => {
                          let result = 1;
                          for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
                          result *= base;
                          }
                          return result;
                          };
                      </code>
                      <p>
                        The arrow comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the function’s
                        body. It expresses something like “this input (the parameters) produces this
                        result (the body)”.
                        When there is only one parameter name, you can omit the parentheses
                        around the parameter list. If the body is a single expression, rather than a
                        block in braces, that expression will be returned from the function. So, these
                        two definitions of square do the same thing:
                      </p>

                      <code>
                        const square1 = (x) => { return x * x; };
                        const square2 = x => x * x;
                      </code>

                      <p>
                        When an arrow function has no parameters at all, its parameter list is just
                        an empty set of parentheses.
                      </p>
